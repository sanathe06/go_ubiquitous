# Project Overview
In this project, you will build a wearable watch face for Sunshine to run on an Android Wear device.

# Why this Project?
Android Wear is an exciting way to integrate your app more directly into users’ lives. As a new developer, it will be important for you to understand how to perform this integration. This project gives you an opportunity to design a companion app for Sunshine, tying it to a watch face in order to enrich the experience.

# What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:

- Understand the fundamentals of Android Wear.
- Design for multiple watch form factors.
- Communicate between a mobile device and a wearable device.

# Required Behavior
- App works on both round and square face watches.
- App displays the current time.
- App displays the high and low temperatures.
- App displays a graphic that summarizes the day’s weather (e.g., a sunny image, rainy image, cloudy image, etc.).
- Watch face obtains weather data by talking with a copy of Sunshine running on a device paired to the watch.
- App conforms to common standards found in the Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines.
